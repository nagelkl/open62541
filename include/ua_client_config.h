 *
 * Client Configuration
 * --------------------
 *
 * The client configuration is used for setting connection parameters and
 * additional settings used by the client.
 * The configuration should not be modified after it is passed to a client.
 * Currently, only one client can use a configuration at a time.
 *
 * Examples for configurations are provided in the ``/plugins`` folder.
 * The usual usage is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Create a client configuration with default settings as a starting point
 * 2. Modifiy the configuration, e.g. modifying the timeout
 * 3. Instantiate a client with it
 * 4. After shutdown of the client, clean up the configuration (free memory)
 *
 * The :ref:`tutorials` provide a good starting point for this. */
